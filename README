pydpiper is a set of python modules that offers programmatic control over pipelines. 

It is very much under active development. 

Classes for building and controling the pipeline can be found in pydpiper/pipeline.py. 
The location of the pipeline directory must be in the users PYTHONPATH. 

The code for executing the pipeline can be found in pipeline_executor.py.

Application modules that utilize the pipeline class definitions are currently in applications folder. These applications may be moved to a separate repository at a later date.
