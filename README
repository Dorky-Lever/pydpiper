pydpiper is a set of python modules that offers programmatic control over pipelines. 

It is very much under active development. 

Classes for building and controling the pipeline can be found in pipeline/pipeline.py. 
The location of the pipeline directory must be in the users PYTHONPATH. 

The code for executing the pipeline can be found in pipeline_executor.py.

Ultimately both pipeline and pipeline_executor will have a setup.py script, so it can be installed via: python setup.py install

Application modules that utilize the pipeline class definitions are currently in applications folder. These applications may be moved to a separate repository at a later date.
