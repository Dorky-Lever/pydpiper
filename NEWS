New in Version 1.6
====================
* fix to MAGeT.py. Solves issues with the voxel_vote command. 

New in Version 1.5
====================
* added retrying/resubmitting of failed files to the server. At this moment
  each stage is resubmitted twice before considering it truly failed. This solves
  an apparent nfs race condition issue.

New in Version 1.4
====================
* added a warning statement when the server is finished running and shutting
  down. There is still a communication issue, and sometimes executors do not
  shut down correctly.
* added verbosity option to the server. By default is now less verbose
* changed the output of the server to the user. Now displays more meaningful
  information: total number of stages to be run, and the number of stages that
  have already been processed.
* bug fix in the pipeline executor: can now be launched from the command line
  again

New in Version 1.3
====================
* huge amounts of code restructuring
* server now launches and relaunches executors (keeps track of executors that
  are registered with the server. However, for now does not check whether the 
  registered executors are alive once in a while)
* executors can kill themselves when they've been idle for too long. They can also
  "drain" themselves (not accept any new jobs) after a certain time and then 
  shutdown when the running jobs have finished.
* added an interrupt handler for ctr+c to the server and executors
* executors on shutdown kill the running processes by using their process IDs (pid)
* a whole bunch of changes to the twolevel_model_building code... (see GitHub)
* a whole bunch of changes to the registration_chain code... (see GitHub)
