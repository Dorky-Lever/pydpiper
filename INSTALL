To install pydpiper, both the current source and most stable release can be downloaded from github:

https://github.com/mfriedel/pydpiper

Using the Downloads button, access the .tar.gz or .zip file.
Unzip and untar and change into the source directory (e.g. cd pydpiper)
Run: python setup.py install

In the event of an install error, check the output log to ensure all prerequisite packages are installed.

In addition, the py.test package (http://doc.pytest.org/en/latest/) is not required, but is necessary in
running any of the test scripts found in /tests.
